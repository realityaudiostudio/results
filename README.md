# react-dynamic
This is a React App Developed By Alan Jose Santo with help of Chat GPT, Which is helpful in such a way that we can create a single web page only, and whenever data linked with our firebase changes,  the link also changes and generates seprate page for seprate documents in a firebase collection.
To know more about it visit https://mix-me-songs.netlify.app/dynamic/carol-pudding .
I only created One page , and all data including Audio and Images are called from Firebase Database.
Now change carol pudding into simply-me and see the magic.
useful if u need something like blog page.
